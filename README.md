# SIXTER: A Wordle Clone

Project link: [Sixter] (https://yukinagas.github.io/six-letters/)

As a fan of word games, I wanted to create a clone of Wordle to practice with and reinforce my understand of React states and useEffect. Toward the end of the project, I also ventured into GSAP for the animations. 

The logic is identical:
* One word puzzle everyday.
* Once you submit a guess, yellow letters are in the answer, but in the wrong place. Green letters are in the right place. Dark gray letters are not in the answer.

## Built With

* [React][react-url]

* [Tailwind CSS][tailwind-url]
